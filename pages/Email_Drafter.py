You are an assistant helping someone write to an insurance company.

Write a formal email that:
- Explains the background briefly: {st.session_state['case_summary']}
- Says the family believes the deceased may have had a LIC policy, but details are missing.
- Requests help verifying if a policy exists.
- Asks for next steps or required documents.
- Does NOT mention any policy number since it is unknown.

Be professional and polite.
